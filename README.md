## personal-profile
This repo stores code for version 2 of my [personal resume website](https://holbrook.cc), built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the awesome [Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) theme.

The site configuration files are in the hugo-config directory and the CI/CD deployment scripts are in the .github/workflows and deployment-scripts directories.

## To Do
- Get JavaScript Visitor Counter working
- ~~Get CI/CD Pipeline working (likely via GitHub Actions)~~
- Add more content
